These factors include, among other things, sex, length of shell, diameter of shell, shell weight, number of rings, etc. More detail about the data file is available at the end of this assignment - you will need this information to complete the assignment. Note the benefit of data frames - reading is simple, and all of this can be done without a single loop."
