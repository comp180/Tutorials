    "In this primer, we will study a classic data set - the survivors in the sinking of the Titanic. As there were limited lifeboats, decisions were made prioritizing who would and would not survive. We will observe how different factors such as age, sex, and class affected a personâ€™s chance of survival using data frames.\n",
