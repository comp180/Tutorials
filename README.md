# Comp 180 Tutorials
These tutorials are designed for students in the Comp 180 - Computing and Data Analysis for the Sciences course at Loyola University Chicago. They are divided into 3 languages: [Python]( https://www.python.org/), [R]( https://www.r-project.org/), and [Octave]( https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). The tutorials should be as identical as possible across all languages except for the code and explanation of the code. Explanations and comments are written for an audience with little or no coding experience. 

You need to [install Jupyter Notebooks]( https://github.com/comp180/Tutorials/blob/master/How%20to%20Get%20Jupyter%20Notebooks.md) to run and edit these .ipynb files.

Jupyter Notebooks comes with Python. The following links show how to use R and Octave on Jupyter Notebooks.
