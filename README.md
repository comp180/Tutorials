# Tutorials
These tutorials are designed for students in the Comp 180- Computing and Data Analysis for the Sciences course at Loyola University-Chicago. They are divided into 3 languages: Python, R, and Octave. The tutorials should be as identical as possible across all languages except for the code and explanation of the code. Explanations and comments are written for an audience with little or no coding experience. These .ipynb files can be run and edited in Jupyter Notebooks.
